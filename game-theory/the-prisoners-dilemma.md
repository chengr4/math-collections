# The Prisoner's Dilemma

## The Situation

- Two suspects are arrested.
- The police think they were trying to rob a store.
    - But the cops can only prove that the suspects were trespassing.
- Thus, the police need one of criminals to rat out the other.

### The Potential Deal

- If no one confesses to robbery, the police can only charge the prisoners for trespassing.
    - Punishment: 1 month in jail each.
- If one confesses, the other doesn't, the police will be lenient on the rat and severely punish the quiet one.
    - Punishment: 12 months in jail for the quiet one; 0 months for the rat
- If both confess, the police punish both of them equally.
    - Punishment: 8 months in jail each.
